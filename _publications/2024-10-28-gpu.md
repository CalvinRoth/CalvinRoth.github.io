collection: publications
permalink: "/publications/gpu"
excerpt: 'This paper presents software advances to easily exploit computer architectures consisting of a multi-core CPU and CPU+GPU to accelerate diverse types of high-performance computing (HPC) applications using a single code implementation. The paper describes and demonstrates the performance of the open-source C++ matrix and array (MATAR) library. More information can be found [here](http://calvinroth.github.io/assets/papers/Gpu.pdf)'
