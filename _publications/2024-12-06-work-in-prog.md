title: "Work in Progress: Graph Anonymizatio"
collection: publications
excerpt: 'This work considers the following problem: We have a data consisting of an unidrected network with labelled nodes. We want to be able to realize a  unlabeled possibly permuted version of the network publically with revealing details about the network(known as the published graph).  The best way to describe the privacy goals is to consider an attacker who has the published graph, the list of ids in the network, and another network they learned outside what we gave them. We call this second graph the crawled graph. The goal of the attack then is to use these two graphs to uncover the ids of nodes in the network. Our work focuses on possible defenses against such attacks while preserving other useful information about the network ex. the degree distribution of the true hidden network and the published graph should be similar.'
