I am a 2nd year PhD student at the University of Minnesota studying industrial and Systems Engineering. My advisor Ankur Mani. Previously, I completed bachelors of science in mathematics and computer science and a master's in computer science. My interests revolve around studying graph theory and networks, how to reason despite uncertainity and partial information of the network structure as well as ways to apply this to real world social and economic problems.  I have interned at Activated Research Company as a software developer, Los Alamos National Lab where I worked on parallel computing and on the [MATAR](https://github.com/lanl/MATAR) project specifically, and did an REU at University of Connecticut where I did a project on Quantum Key Distribution.
