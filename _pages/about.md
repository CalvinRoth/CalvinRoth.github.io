## Introduction 
Hello, I am a 4th year PhD student at the University of Minnesota studying industrial and Systems Engineering. My advisor is [Ankur Mani](https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/amani). Previously, I completed Bachelors of science in Mathematics and Computer Science and a master's in computer science.  My core interest is primarily around Graph Theory especially algorithms to deal with information and noise over networks. This study has led to by development of Stochastic Processes, Game Theory, AI, Causal Inference, Computational Methods, Machine Learning, and Social Commerence. 

## Awards and Honors 
* Awarded 100 project from [R&D World](https://www.rdworldonline.com/rd-100-winners-for-2024-are-announced/) of the year for my involvment with the Fierro and Matar programs. Paper can be found [here](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/11/673).
* Studied at Simons Laufer Mathematical Sciences Institute summer program for computational economics
* UMN 2023 Travel grant Awardee
* UMN 2024 Travel grant Awardee
<!-- My previous experiences include
* A summer internship at Activated Research Company where I did Ardunio programming and website development.
* An REU at University of Connecticut where I developed algorithms for quantum key distribution and algorithms to uncover the optimal information loss. 
* Internship at Los Alamos 
I have interned at Activated Research Company as a software developer, Los Alamos National Lab where I worked on parallel computing and on the [MATAR](https://github.com/lanl/MATAR) project specifically, and did an REU at University of Connecticut where I did a project on Quantum Key Distribution.  -->
